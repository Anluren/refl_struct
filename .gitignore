# Exclude all files with executable bit set (requires .gitattributes)
# This requires a .gitattributes file with:
# [attr]binary -diff -merge -text
# [attr]exec -text
#
# Then use:
# *.sh    exec
# *       binary
#
# But .gitignore cannot filter by file mode alone, so for full exclusion of executables by permission, use:
# git update-index --assume-unchanged <file>
